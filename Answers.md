1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?

React is a javascript library for building UI.  It solves the probem of 
managing large amounts of data and 'reacts' or updates the data seemlessly by using state.  Instead of manipulating the DOM, react uses a virtual DOM that in turn does the minmum number of DOM operations to update new state.

2.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?

I would say thinking in React means that you are now thinking about 
creating a user interface by being able code with JSX, javascript,
html, and css more congruently to create the desired outcome.  Class
and function components are important tools to using REACT as wells as using state and props to pass data to your functions.

3.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.

A Class/Stateful component is where the state lives or where the state is referenced.  Functional/Prsentational component is where the state props are passed to in order to display the data how you desire.

4.  Describe state.

State is the word to describe a set of data that is able to be accessed by your react application.

5.  Describe props.

Props is short for properties.  Props are used to pass the state around
throughout your react application.  If you add a property to a called 
function, the function can now use the state data passed through to it.
